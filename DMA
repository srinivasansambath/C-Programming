OUTPUT:
Compilation Error.
/* While this program is excecuted in Turbo C++, the object is created during runtime of the program.
C++ doesn't allow to create objects during runtime of the program.
So error message prompts.
But in Online compiler like gdb, object creation during runtime is allowed, so no error occurs.*/
